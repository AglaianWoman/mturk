   <p><strong>This is a GOOD example of an idea submitted to us:</strong></p>
   <div style="background: #F7F2DA; padding: 5px 20px;">
      <p>I am finance officer for a startup that has grown from 1-30 people over the course of 2 years. During the early growth phase a lot of people signed for many different SaaS services such as growth hacking tools, analytics tools etc.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, due to the disorganized nature of the early phase I am finding it difficult to hunt down all the different services that were signed up for. Also, since some early people have left I have no way of knowing what the password is or the email that was used to signup. Yet, various company credit cards are still getting billed!</p>
      <p>The ideal solution to this problem would be a single place to view and manage all our SaaS tool subscriptions. A basic database type tool would be a start, but it would be even more useful if the tool could somehow control the actual spending and I could assign different users different amounts of monthly spends available for SaaS purchases.</p>
      <p>Of course basic analytics would be very helpful so that I could keep a close eye on our overall SaaS spend on a monthly and yearly basis. It would also be helpful if it could keep track of emails and passwords.</p>
